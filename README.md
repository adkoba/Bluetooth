Schematic and board layout of a bluetooth audio module for headphone

The aim of the project is to integrate in my [old personal headphones](http://shop.panasonic.com/shop/model/RP-HTX7-K1) a bluetooth module to replace the wire cable wich is cut. The project mainly consists of a refactoring of the following [tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/rn-52-bluetooth-hookup-guide?_ga=1.104742537.805651348.1414575974) proposed by sparkfun.
